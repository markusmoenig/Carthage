# Carthage

Carthage will be a light weight casual game engine for the Apple Ecosystem. It is based on the lastest Swift / SwiftUI and acts as an abstraction layer to SceneKit and RealityKit. Meaning that you can switch your projects between these two as needed and on the fly.

Carthage uses JavaScript to script your games. JavaScript is fast, tightly integrated into the Swift ecosystem and is probably the most well known scripting language around. I might add a visual scripting language later.

Carthage is currently in the proof of concept phase.

## Abstract

I wanted to create some casual games but the major game engines were too heavy for me to get involved in. SceneKit and RealityKit look good to me, each with their own advantages (SceneKit being available for watchOS / Apple TV and RealityKit being more modern). However as I wanted to create my games live with an overall scripting system and be able to switch between SceneKit and RealityKit an abstraction layer looked like the best solution to me, thus Carthage.
